## Addition

#### Overview

Write a method to return the factorial of a non-negative number.

<div class="alert alert-secondary" style="text-align:center">

$${ nfac = n! }$$
</div>

#### Algorithm

Inputs:
- n = A non-negative integer 

Outputs:
- nfac = n factorial

#### Unit Tests

Unit tests provide a way to verify that units of code behave as expected. You will be graded on the tests in the "Test" tab which have a list of inputs and expected outputs along with the points awarded for each of those outputs.

#### Instructions

Find the "Select Language" dropdown at the bottom left of the editor section to the right. Choose a language to get some method template code to get you started. DO NOT change the method signatures (method name, argument types, and ordering) in the provided starter code.

Work on the code in your own workspace. Then copy it back into the editor and submit. You can save and come back to it later if you are not ready to submit.
